# Prasanna Jha — Portfolio

A modern, dark-themed personal portfolio built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. The site showcases my work as a Computer Science student and full-stack developer at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, featuring smooth scroll-triggered animations powered by **Framer Motion**, glassmorphism UI elements, and a responsive layout designed for all screen sizes.

The portfolio highlights featured projects — including **Carbon Horizon** (an AI-powered climate platform), **NoteLinkAI** (an AI learning tool), **SafeRoute** (a mobile safety app), **NepUnite** (a community web platform), and **Escape the Virtual Maze** (an educational visual novel) — alongside an interactive experience timeline, a categorized skills grid, and a contact form. The design follows a sleek indigo-and-violet accent palette on a deep charcoal background, with attention to typography (Outfit, Inter, JetBrains Mono) and subtle micro-animations throughout.
